## LibGA
A library for implementing genetic algorithms. Users supply a chromosome
representation, crossover function, mutation function, and fitness function.
This library glues them together into a working genetic algorithm. Advanced GA
techniques are planned as future additions.

See the examples/ directory for guidance on how to use this library.
